Event Management & Ticketing System

This project is a web-based Event Management & Ticketing System built for a hackathon.
It allows users to browse events, book tickets, and receive a QR code for entry. Organizers can manage attendees and validate tickets from a dashboard.

The system simulates how real-world conferences and seminars handle ticket booking and entry validation.
